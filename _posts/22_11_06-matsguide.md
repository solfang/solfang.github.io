# What should I do with my materials?

Notes:
- embed recipes as profit/H
- ideally give 2-3 options per mat and my recommendations (Give realistic advice, e.g.gems: can jut sell. Meat: imperial meals but that's a bit of a rabbit hole though still woth getting into)
 + don't spend too much time on very obvious items
- stress importance of taxing self-gathered mats (e.g. for making concentrateds)
- include _all_ mats of the spot
- TODO: get warflash to add a way to link db recipes

Checks:
- Make sure each for usage I link the recipe and craft type is easy to see (e.g. not hidden in a 'product of recipe' tab), else annotate it
