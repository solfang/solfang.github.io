There's no way around it: Alchemy is pretty screwed, and this is coming from a g36 alchemist.

If you still feel like leveling alchemy, this post can hopefully provide guidance.

## How to Get Materials for Alchemy
- <img src="/images/icons/trace_of_the_earth.png" height="30"> **Traces**: nodes / pre-order
- <img src="/images/icons/fruit_of_nature.png" height="30"> **Fruit of x**: hoe gathering / farming / pre-order / [Liana's daily quest](https://grumpygreen.cricket/liana/#:~:text=or%20Onion%20x50.-,Liana%E2%80%99s%20Daily%20Alchemy%20Quests,-Quest%20Name%3A)
- <img src="/images/icons/ash_sap.png" height="30"> **Saps**: gathering (sapping) / pre-order
- <img src="/images/icons/purified_water.png" height="30"> **Purified Water**: general goods vendor at Sandgrain Bazaar (5k silver)
- <img src="/images/icons/sunrise_herb.png" height="30"> **Herbs**: gathering / market / herb vendors, e.g. Nieves in Calpheon (500-575 silver)
- <img src="/images/icons/mushroom.png" height="30"> **Mushrooms**: farming/ market / mushroom vendor Brandio in Calpheon (950-1k silver)

## EXP Buffs
- Recommended: seafood cron meal, verdure draught
- Optional: Guild buff, perfume of swiftness, book of life, book of old moon, birthday cake

# Five Methods to Level Alchemy:


## 1) Reagents -  "The Pickled Vegetables of alchemy"
- Recipes: 

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/clear_liquid_reagent.png" height="30"> [Clear Liquid Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5301)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/pure_powder_reagent.png" height="30"> [Pure Powder Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5302)

- EXP: 400
- Bottlenecks: None
- Level requirement: beginner 1

The [Pickled Vegetables](https://bdolytics.com/cooking/market/9202) equivalent of alchemy (low effort spammable EXP). Except that they are less profit and EXP than Pickled Vegetables. Welcome to alchemy :)

Reagents are usually profitable to craft, especially considering the random procs (gold bars, caphras stones etc.), and you'll have no problems selling them on the market.

Purified Water can be bought from the general goods vendor at Sandgrain Bazaar.

**If all you want is to reach artisan/master, don't bother with anything else but reagents**


## 2) T2 Bloods - "Perfect to burn a hole in your wallet"
- Recipes: 

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/legendary_beast's_blood.png" height="30"> [Legendary Beast Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6351)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/tyrant's_blood.png" height="30"> [Tyrant's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6352)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/clown's_blood.png" height="30"> [Clown's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6353)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/sinner's_blood.png" height="30"> [Sinner's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6354)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/wise_man's_blood.png" height="30"> [Wise Man's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6355)

- EXP: 800 
- Bottlenecks: blood/traces/node mats
- Level req: professional 1

[Sinner's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6354) and [Clown's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6353) are the easiest to craft and used in many recipes.
At the time of writing this, they are hella flooded on the market.
That means you'll have two options:

A) accept the loss (somewhere around 100 mil/H in material cost) and let them stockpile in your storage, hoping that they become more useful in the future.

B) Use them in further alchemy recipes.

Clown's Blood can be crafted into:
- [Elixir of Shock](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/762) - requires cedar sap
- [EXP Elixir](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/714) - requires pine sap
- [Elixir of Human Hunt](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/670) - requires maple sap
- [Oil of Fortitude](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6603) - requires fruit of nature -> see full recipe chain below

Sinner's Blood can be crafted into:
- [Elixir of Demihuman Hunt](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/678) - requires fir sap
- [Worker's Elixir](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/724) - requires ash sap
- [Oil of Corruption](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6604) - requires fruit of the sun -> see full recipe chain below

As you can see, there is no 'easy' way to offload T2 bloods. Next to the bottlenecks above, you'll want to keep an eye out for the market volume of these elixirs using <https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market>. Elixirs like demihuman hunt tend to sell well while others have very limited volume.


## 3) Gather-heavy methods - "EXP + silver - sanity"


### Method A) Tenacious Origin of Life
- Recipe: <img src="/images/icons/teancious_origin_of_life.png" height="30"> [Tenacious Origin of Life](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mz_NnRBVHC6r6MQqf8abfYaZh547lntqcnkjnwJfXCU/edit?usp=sharing)
- EXP: 800 
- Bottlenecks: None 
- Level requirement: artisan 1

**The method**: Gather wild herbs at Behr, turn the herbs into Tenacious Origin of Life and turn the fruits into oils. Alternatively, you can avoid any gathering by buying the herbs from a vendor, which comes out to a ~70 mil/h loss.

**Liquidation:** Sell the Tenacious Origins of Life to any vendor. Sell the oils on the market or use in further recipes.

**Pro**: great way to level gathering + alchemy while profiting

**Con**: Crafting Tenacious Origin of Life is _very active_: you can only do a few minutes of crafts at a time since the herbs are heavy. You can use 'bunch of ...', e.g. bunch of silver azaleas to lower the weight requirement. 17 bunches replace 50 white herbs in the recipe.


### Method B) Metal Solvent
- Recipe: <img src="/images/icons/metal_solvent.png" height="30"> [Metal Solvent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/4076)
- EXP: 800
- Bottlenecks: rough stone, potentially trace of savagery
- Level requirement: professional 1

**The method:** Gather rough stone at Pilgrim's Haven, turn the rough stone into metal solvent. There's one caveat: without maids, gathering at pilgrim's will not be a nice experience.

**Liquidation:** Sell the metal solvent to the market or use it to craft pure crystals (pure icon crystal, pure copper crystal etc.) via processing.

**Pro**: great way to level gathering + alchemy while profiting

### Method C) Spirit Perfume Elixir
- Recipe: <img src="/images/icons/spirit_perfume_elixir.png" height="30">  [Spirit Perfume Elixir](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/781) 
- EXP: 2000
- Bottlenecks: dead tree essence, fruit of nature, loopy tree sap, colored flowers
- Level requirement: skilled 1

**The method**: Gather tons of stuff and craft spirit perfume elixirs. Gather spots:

- Loopy tree sap: [Loopy Tree Forest](https://youtu.be/B-TLLJs636w) (loopy tree sap + dead tree essence)
- Dead tree essence: [Garmoth's Nest](https://youtu.be/ucCUibM1B0g)
- Fruit of nature: 1) farm {magical dalvenia alrea](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_GdYRdKj-ocUyypo5WLT5fThDiKa5bzOfSoH3lhwPg/edit?usp=sharing) or [magical purple mushroom](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_GdYRdKj-ocUyypo5WLT5fThDiKa5bzOfSoH3lhwPg/edit?usp=sharing) 2) [Liana's daily quest](https://grumpygreen.cricket/liana/#:~:text=or%20Onion%20x50.-,Liana%E2%80%99s%20Daily%20Alchemy%20Quests,-Quest%20Name%3A) 3) Hoe gathering, wich includes the flowers.
- Flowers: (violet/purple pink/yellow/blue/sky blue): [Lake Flondor](https://youtu.be/0BiKsg1aKLA). The recipe works with any of these flowers.

**Liquidation:** Sell the spirit perfume elixirs to the market.

**Pro**: very profitable, high EXP per craft

**Con**: lots of gathering required for each craft. Also, fruit of nature will be a hard bottleneck.

**Tip**: Since spirit perfume elixirs always proc 1 (mastery has no effect), use silver embroidered clothes for the extra EXP.

## 4) Imperial Alchemy - "Has seen better times"
I have a hard time recommending anything because boxes with high EXP elixirs usually are a horrendous loss to craft.
If you don't care about money then just pick a box with manageable bottlenecks and a high EXP elixir.

The one elixir I can recommend is [Elixir of Spells](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/692) (920 EXP), which goes into an artisan box and requires gathering maple sap.

See <https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/imperial> for a list of alchemy imperial boxes.

**Pro**: guaranteed demand from the NPC

**Con**: opportunity cost compared to doing cooking imperials

## 5) Market Alchemy - "Preorder and pray"
**The method**:
1. Slap a pre-order on any fruit, trace and sap in existence.
2. Wait for pre-orders to fill.
3. Crafts fruits into oils, traces into bloods, oils+traces+saps into elixirs.

Having bottleneck materials like fruits, traces etc. enables you to form recipe chains all the way up to T3 elixirs, which in total is a lot of EXP.

The classic recipe chains are:

- [Pure Powder Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5302) -> [Legendary Beast Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6351) -> [Oil of Regeneration](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6601) ->  [Elixir of Assassination](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/696) / [Elixir of Frenzy](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/672)

- [Pure Powder Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5302) -> [Tyrant's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6352) -> [Oil of Storms](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6602) -> [Golden Hand Elixir](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/674) / [Elixir of Detection](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/698)

- [Clear Liquid Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5301) -> [Clown's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6353) -> [Oil of Fortitude](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6603) -> [Grim Reaper's Elixir](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/712) / [Elixir of Draining](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/676)

- [Clear Liquid Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5301) -> [Sinner's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6354) -> [Oil of Corruption](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6604) -> [Elixir of Carnage](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/718) / [Elixir of Perforation](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/680)

- [Clear Liquid Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5301) -> [Wise Man's Blood](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6355) -> [Oil of Tranquility](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/6605) -> [Elixir of Death](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/686) / [Elixir of Sky](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/720)

Some of these recipes can be further crafted into draughts: 

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/verdure_draught.png" height="30"> [Verdure Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/791)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/beast's_draught.png" height="30"> [Beast's Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/792)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/giant's_draught.png" height="30"> [Giant's Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/793)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/savage_draught.png" height="30"> [Savage Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/794)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/celerity_draught.png" height="30"> [Celerity Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/796)

<img align="left" src="/images/icons/unbridled_celerity_draught.png" height="30"> [Unbridled Celerity Draught](https://bdolytics.com/processing/market/797)

The draught craft is done by simple alchemy and gives only a sliver of alchemy EXP. The main benefit of draughts is that they're an easy way to liquidate elixirs.
You can use ibellab's essence, bought from material vendors, to craft 10 draughts at once.

Use <https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market> to find recipes.

## Some quotes from my old post on leveling alchemy that I like:

`Alchemy is a skill were you should not focus on crafts for XP but just crafts for $$. You can easily lose bills going for guru or make bills. I always recommend to people after master alchemy unless they have billions of silver they want to throw away just focus on making things that are profitable and the xp will come.` - Bearist

```In alchemy, there's always a trade-off between EXP, profit and effort to make a recipe. Unlike cooking, there's no single recipe that can be spammed out for good EXP without either throwing away money or running into bottlenecks. That's just the current state of alchemy. Is spamming reagents to guru possible? Jup. Is it fast or efficient? Hell no.
Therefore I recommend to mainly focus on profit and let EXP come naturally.
Get familiar with any of the profit calculators like bdolytics and figure out a wide array of potentially profitable recipes. At any time, a different set of recipes will be profitable in the current market. Figuring out the currently profitable recipes and making+selling them will not only yield the best profit but likely also the best EXP. Diversifying is key here, same as high-end market cooking really. The best EXP is also where the best profit is at. Draughts can be a good starting point cause they're good EXP, have high turnover and tend to always be profitable with some combination of making/buying the sub-elixirs.```

Grumpygreen featured it on their alchemy guide so I guess it's an aite quote.

I just scribbled this post in an afternoon. Will extend with more info if people request it.
