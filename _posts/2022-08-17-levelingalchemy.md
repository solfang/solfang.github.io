There's no way around it: Alchemy is pretty screwed, and this is coming from a g36 alchemist.

If you still feel like leveling alchemy, this post can hopefully provide guidance.


## Why Alchemy is Difficult to Level
I'll compare alchemy to cooking since they're fairly similar.
- Almost every recipe is bottlenecked by either traces, fruits, saps or even node materials like spirit's leaf or bloody tree knot.
- Low demand for alchemy products
- Alchemy mastery has almost 0 effect on EXP
- Alchemy is notorious for having EXP memers who are ready to throw away billions of silver to level alchemy for the memes.

## How to get Materials
- Traces: nodes / pre-order
- Fruit of x: hoe gathering / farming / pre-order
- Saps: gathering (sapping) / pre-order
- Purified water: general goods vendor at Sandgrain Bazaar (5k silver)
- Herbs: gathering / market / herb vendors, e.g. Nieves in Calpheon (500-575 silver)
- Mushrooms: farming/ market / Mushroom vendor Brandio in Calpheon (950-1k silver)

## EXP Buffs
- Recommended: seafood cron meal, verdure draught
- Optional: Guild buff, perfume of swiftness, book of life, book of old moon, birthday cake

# Five Methods to Level Alchemy:


## 1) Reagents -  "low EXP, low effort"
- Recipes: <img src="/images/icons/clear_liquid_reagent.png" height="30"> [Clear Liquid Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5301), <img src="/images/icons/pure_powder_reagent.png" height="30"> [Pure Powder Reagent](https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market/5302)
- EXP: 400
- Bottlenecks: None
- Level requirement: beginner 1

The  <img src="/images/icons/pickled_vegetables.png" height="30"> Pickled Vegetables equivalent of alchemy. Except that it's less profitable and less EXP. Welcome to alchemy :)
Purified water can be bought from the general goods vendor at Sandgrain Bazaar.

**If all you want is to reach artisan/master, don't bother with anything else but reagents**


## 2) T2 Bloods - "medium EXP, high cost"
- Recipes: Sinner's Blood, Clown's Blood, Wise Man's Blood, Tyrant's Blood,  Legendary Beast Blood
- EXP: 800 
- Bottlenecks: blood/traces/node mats
- Level req: prof 1

Sinner's blood and clown's blood are the easiest to craft and used in many recipes.
Though at the time of writing this, they are hella flooded on the market.
Crafting them just for EXP without


## 3) Gather-heavy methods - "EXP+profit but active"
### Method A) Tenacious Origin of Life
- EXP: 800 
- Bottlenecks: None 
- Level requirement: art1

**The strategy**: Gather wild herbs (at Behr), turn the herbs into Tenacious Origin of Life, turn the fruits into oils.

**Pro**: great way to level gathering + alchemy while profiting

**Con**: Crafting Tenacious Origin of Life is __very active__: you can only do a few minutes of crafts at a time since the herbs are heavy.

### Method B) Metal Solvent
- EXP: 800
- Bottlenecks: rough stone, sometimes trace of savagery
- Level requirement: prof 1

**The strategy:** Gather rough stone at Pilgrim's Haven, turn the rough stone into metal solvent.

**Pro**: great way to level gathering + alchemy while profiting

### Method C) Spirit Perfume Elixir
- EXP: 2000
- Bottlenecks: lots
- Level requirement: skilled 1

**The method**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDDI2DaLlII>

**Rotations**: <https://bit.ly/GatheringRotations>

The recipe used to require purple flowers but nowadays any flower works.

**Pro**: very profitable, high EXP per craft

**Con**: lots of gathering required for each craft

## 4) Imperial Alchemy - "has seen better times"
I have a hard time recommending anything because boxes with high EXP elixirs usually are a horrendous loss to craft.
If you don't care about money then just pick a box with manageable bottlenecks and a high EXP elixir.

The one elixir I can recommend is Elixir of Spells (920 EXP), which requires gathering maple sap.

See <https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/imperial>

**Pro**: guaranteed demand from the NPC

**Con**: opportunity cost compared to doing cooking imperials

### 5) Market alchemy - "Preorder and pray"
**The method**:
1. Slap a pre-order on any fruit, trace and sap in existence.
2. Wait for pre-orders to fill.
3. Crafts fruits into oils, traces into bloods, oils+traces+saps into elixirs.

Use <https://bdolytics.com/alchemy/market> to find recipes.
The table can be sorted and also filtered via the search field.

It helps if you have an understanding of the alchemy market, e.g. what creates demand for alchemy products (at the time of writing this it's PVP players who need elixirs and adventure logs).
Bottleneck materials like fruits are used in very profitable recipes so all EXP memes aside you should consider


## Some quotes from my old post on leveling alchemy that I like:
A wise :bear: once said:

`Alchemy is a skill were you should not focus on crafts for XP but just crafts for $$. You can easily lose bills going for guru or make bills. I always recommend to people after master alchemy unless they have billions of silver they want to throw away just focus on making things that are profitable and the xp will come.` - Bearist

```In alchemy, there's always a trade-off between EXP, profit and effort to make a recipe. Unlike cooking, there's no single recipe that can be spammed out for good EXP without either throwing away money or running into bottlenecks. That's just the current state of alchemy. Is spamming reagents to guru possible? Jup. Is it fast or efficient? Hell no.
Therefore I recommend to mainly focus on profit and let EXP come naturally.
Get familiar with any of the profit calculators like bdolytics and figure out a wide array of potentially profitable recipes. At any time, a different set of recipes will be profitable in the current market. Figuring out the currently profitable recipes and making+selling them will not only yield the best profit but likely also the best EXP. Diversifying is key here, same as high-end market cooking really. The best EXP is also where the best profit is at. Draughts can be a good starting point cause they're good EXP, have high turnover and tend to always be profitable with some combination of making/buying the sub-elixirs.```

Grumpygreen featured it on their alchemy guide so I guess it's an aite quote.

I just scribbled this post in an afternoon. Will extend with more info if people request it.
