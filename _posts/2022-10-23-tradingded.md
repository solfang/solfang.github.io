Disclaimer: This is not a guide on how to set up a trade empire. I aim to give you realistic expectations of what you're getting into with trading. I'll be looking at the moneymaking potential, roughly outline the required setup and show for which playstyle trading can make sense.

# People make billions with trading! Or do they?

You'll sometimes see players talk about huge crate turn-ins such as (taken from YT video titles):

and probably start to wonder how trading can generate this insane amount of money.
So let's break it down.

What some people refer to as *trading* or a *crate empire* actually consists of multiple parts:
1. **Worker nodes**
2. **Processing**
3. **Trading (crate making and turn-in)**

When you see someone talk about a trade turn-in, keep in mind that the money from those crates comes from a mix of worker empire, processing and trading. And the crates have been produced over weeks or even months.

People commonly mix up different income streams for trading, more than in any other lifeskills. The big problem in my eyes is that those numbers only refer to the value gained and tell us nothing about the profit. For comparison, let's look at cooking, where materials from workers, processing and farming all come together. Cooking Valencia meals can easily create multiple bil/H of **value**. But if you look closer, the cooking **profit** is significantly lower and can even be negative. That's why cooks talk about cooking income in terms of profit rather than value. So why don't traders do it? I get it, turning in 30+ bil of crates is satisfying. But if you're interested in getting into trading, you should be aware of the different income streams and the activities involved.

Let's break down the income streams with an example: the renown <!-- db_item-55840-0 -->

<img src="/files/tradingded/trading_profit.png">

As you can see,  a <!-- db_item-55840-0 --> traded from Grana into Valencia with master 10 trading sells for `427,157` silver. But how much of that value was created by trading? 5 birch, 5 fir and 5 cedar plywood are required to craft the crate. When processing from raw materials, that is 37 birch, fir and cedar timber (7.4 timber per plywood) brought in by your worker empire. The unprocessed timber would sell for `227,609 silver (53.3% of the crate sale)`. 

Processing the timber into planks and plywood increases their value by an *additional* `125,601 silver (29.4%)`. 

At this point, you could sell the plywood to the market and still get `82.7%` of the crate sale. 

The last `73,947 silver (17.3%)` are added once you pack the crates and sell them at Valencia, which requires getting crate packers, ideally with the +3 crate packing skill (pack 4 crates at once), maintaining the workshops, transporting the crates and turning in the crates. Transporting crates is not cheap, requiring either your time or using the rather costly NPC transport function.

Notice something? That `17.3%` profit from trading is awfully close to the `~15.5%` you would have to pay when selling the plywood. By packing materials into crates you get to save on the market tax in this example. While trading profits can fluctuate a bit, they will generally stay a small part of the overall crate profit. Since the crate material market is fully player-driven, **material prices will always balance so that trading is only slightly more profitable than selling the crate materials to the market**. If it wasn't, high level-traders could keep buying crate materials off the market, which would eventually bring the prices back up.

In this example, I used EU prices. An auto-updating version of the breakdown can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjIsGf5V6gCrsTuvotx18ZYfPIVS6kOjvK-vmdOojtk/edit?usp=sharing). Note that this sheet is more of a gimmick to show my point about trading profits. To calculate profits for yourself, I recommend using Wolf's trader sheet in the [simple](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trCwiImMtzuM-OWOUnNiMxwKwoRdIgjLIWu-an0-m9k/edit?usp=sharing) or [full](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DEazVbmu-cFtLUndWRfj6D1a21W-FKEr-VbBHBCOqyc/edit?usp=sharing) version.

**We conclude:**
**Trading is an optional step on top of processing, which gives a bit of extra profit and requires a fair bit of extra work:**
- Initial setup: Getting artisan 2 trading and +3 packers (this can take a while!)
- Workshops: CP cost, Feeding crate workers, supplying materials
- Transport: Maintaining a node connection and managing trade wagons or afk ride/ship crates
- Turn-in: Active time spent on the turn-in

This is quite a bit of work but can very well be worth the profit. However, trading faces 2 more problems that often get overlooked.

## Problem #1: Why should I even process crate materials?

Processing is a de-facto requirement for making your own crates. But what if processing crate materials isn't even worth it in the first place?

There are lots of other things to process. Cooking materials for example have huge demand and are even lighter than timber/ores so you can stay afk longer. But are crate materials actually more profitable than those alternatives? You decide! 

The profit in this table auto-updates so you'll always get an up-to-date comparison. It's also why I cannot give you a definite answer as of writing this guide because profits may change in the future.

| Crate Material                  | Cooking Material                |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| <!-- profit_processing-4661 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7105 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4664 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7103 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4667 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7101 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4667 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7106 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4652-->  | <!-- profit_processing-7205 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4654-->  | <!-- profit_processing-7203 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4658 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7201 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4066 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7206 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4067 --> | <!-- profit_processing-9062 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4077 --> | <!-- profit_processing-9063 --> |

Besides, you may decide to spend your time on a different lifeskill entirely, like cooking, bartering or alchemy. I can personally make the most (semi-)afk money from cooking, so I don't have much reason to process.

## Problem #2: Frozen Money

<img src="/files/tradingded/frozen_money.jpg">

When slowly building up a stack of crates over weeks or even months, all the money that goes into producing those crates gets frozen until you turn them in. If you're early in your gear progression, where upgrades are still fairly cheap, freezing billions worth of materials may significantly slow down your progress. For established players who are looking at tens of billions for their next upgrade, this is not so much of an issue. 

Incidentally, some people like trading for this exact same reason: it freezes their money so they can't gamble it away while going for an upgrade. Whenever they have saved enough money for their next upgrade, they do a trade-in and buy the item. I know some people who dearly need this :)

You could also bring up the argument that locking away silver for long periods of time is essentially an investment. While the risk of making a crate is not terribly high, things can occasionally go wrong, like when your crates get destroyed during transport or you forget to connect nodes for the turn-in. It's low risk but also low return: in the above example, we got less than 20% return over multiple weeks of building the crates (not even including the workshop maintenance and transport cost etc). There are more profitable investments with comparable risk if you know what you're doing. For example, you could buy materials for your next cooking/alchemy/enhancing sessions while they're cheap, assuming that they will be more expensive once you need them.

# So when should I consider trading?

Trading has seen a few QoL improvements which make it significantly easier to get into: getting to artisan 2 barely requires 1 stack of crates, you can instantly load a full stack of crates on a horse and an NPC crate transport system has been introduced to the game. In that sense, getting into trading has never been easier. Still, you should bring a good reason to do it.

Trading can be a good way to liquidate processing materials without interacting with the market, which could be either because you don't want to rely on other players or aren't running a **Value Pack**. Besides that, there are few MMOs out there where you can build your own trade empire. Taking materials your workes produced, making crates out of them and shipping them to the other end of the map to sell for 4x the base price sounds fun, doesn't it? I know a few people who do trading purely for fun (shoutout to *Spice and Wolf* fans).

If none of that applies and you're genuinely looking to profit from trading, you should bring a fairly progressed account. This includes an established worker empire, say 350+ CP with mostly professional/artisan workers and being at a point in your gear progression where freezing up billions of silver won't slow down your progress.

Besides that, you'll want to process a lot to keep your workshops from idling. For reference, a +3 crate worker can produce `4 crates x 5 crates per hour x 16 hours = 320 crates per day`. To make a <!-- db_item-55840-0 -->, you're looking at `320 * 5 * 3 = 4,800 plywood` per day, which requires ~50 minutes of processing at 1500 processing mastery.

# Trading without processing? (Margin Trading)

You might say: I don't need to process my own crate materials, I can buy them straight off the market and make money on the side. Well, yes, in theory. In practice, you better bring a damn high trading level, which in turn means spending billions of silver in trash crates to level up trading before you can think about margin trading. I can't speak from experience here as I've never been a margin trader, but when running the numbers you'll see that margin trading is not gonna make you rich, especially considering that you could spend the time and effort on far more profitable lifeskills.

# Summary

### Trading is for you if you...
- Process a lot and have developed a reasonably sized worker empire 
- OR: Can't rely on the marketplace to liquidate materials, for example because you **don't run a Value Pack**
- OR: simply [enjoy running a crate empire](https://tenor.com/view/spice-and-wolf-happy-fresh-air-love-it-holo-gif-14710197) and are not too concerned about profits :)

### Running a crate empire means...
- An initial investment of getting to artisan 2 trading and rolling for workers with the +3 packing skill
- Processing a lot to supply your workshops with materials (you will need to buy materials from the market)
- Managing the crate transport
- Frequently feeding your crate workers
- Cashing in a big stack of silver every few weeks/months

### Trading is not optimal if...
- You only process casually or not at all (see [Problem #1](#problem-1-why-should-i-even-process-crate-materials))
- Locking up silver for weeks/months significantly slows down your progression or is not a good investment in other ways (see [Problem #2](#problem-2-frozen-money))

## Closing thoughts

People have been mixing trading profits with other sources for as long as trading has been around. I highly recommend reading this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8knbu6/current_state_of_crates/dz94nv5/?context=3) on the topic  by Goroshi, who is one of the top-ranked trader's in the world (depending on when you read this probably *the* top ranked trader). 

Also while this post is rather profit-oriented, don't forget that we're playing this game to have fun. I still hope I could give you realistic expectations of what you're getting into with trading and not be fooled by those who claim to make spectacular profits.
