# People make billions with trading! Or do they?

You'll sometimes see players talk about huge crate turn-ins such as (taken from YT video titles):

`Trading in 36 billion worth of crates!`
 or 
 `$43 Billion Crates Traded In 1 Hour`
 
and probably start to wonder how trading can generate this insane amount of money.
So let's break it down.

What some people refer to as *trading* or a *crate empire* actually consist of multiple parts:
1. Worker nodes
2. Processing
3. Trading (crate making and turn-in)

When you see someone talk about a trade-turn in, keep in mind that those crates have been produced over weeks or even months. And the money from those crates comes from a mix of worker empire, processing and trading. 

The big problem I see with the statements above: Those numbers only refer to the value gained and tell us nothing about the profit. For comparison, cooking Valencia meals can easily create`2b mil/H` of **value**, which if you look closer turns out ot be `low` or even `negative` **profit**. Therefore, cooks talk about cooking income in  in terms of profit rather than in  terms of value. So why don't traders do it? Well, they should.  But it's just so convenient to see the whole process of running a worker empire, processing materials, making crates and turning them in as one interconnected activity.

To show you that properly separating profits can give us some very interesting insights, let's do a profit breakdown of the renown<!-- db_item-55840-0 -->:

<img src="/files/processing_faq/trading_profit.png">

As you can see,  a Calpheon Timber Crate traded from Grana into Valencia sells for `427,157` silver. But how much of that value was created by trading? The 5 birch, 5 fir and 5 cedar plywood require 37 timber each (7.4 timber per plywood), which have been brought in by your worker empire. The unprocessed timber would sell for `227,609 silver (53.3% of the crate sale)`. 

Processing the timber into planks and then into plywood increases their value by an *additional* `125,601 silver (29.4% of the crate sale)`. At this point, you could sell the plywood to the market and still get `82.7%` of the crate sale. 

The last `17.3%` are added once you pack the crates and sell them at Valencia, which requires getting workers with the +3 crate packing skill (produce crates 4x faster than regular workers) maintaining the workshops (CP, worker food), transporting the crates (this is a massive cost, requiring either your active time or using the NPC transport function) and turning in the crates.

Notice something? That `17.3%` profit from trading is awfully close to the `~15.5%` you would have to pay when selling the plywood. **Effectively, by packing materials into crates you get to save on the market tax.** 

Depending on your server's prices, trading profits can fall above or below `15.5%` mark, but since the crate material market is entirely player-driven, **prices will always balance so that trading is worth barely more than selling the materials**.

In this example I used EU prices and m10 trading. An auto-updating version of the breakdown can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjIsGf5V6gCrsTuvotx18ZYfPIVS6kOjvK-vmdOojtk/edit?usp=sharing). 

Note that this sheet is more of a gimmick to show my point about trading profits. To calculate profits for yourself, I recommend using Wolf's trader sheet in the [simple](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trCwiImMtzuM-OWOUnNiMxwKwoRdIgjLIWu-an0-m9k/edit?usp=sharing) or [full](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DEazVbmu-cFtLUndWRfj6D1a21W-FKEr-VbBHBCOqyc/edit?usp=sharing) version.

**We conclude:**
**Trading is an optional step on top of processing, which gives a bit of extra profit and requires extra work:**
- Initial setup: Getting artisan 2 trading and +3 packers (this can take a while!)
- Maintenance: Feed crate workers, supply materials
- Transporting: Maintain a node connection and managing trade wagons or afk ride/ship crates
- Turn-in: Active time spent on the turn-in

## Problem #1: Why should I even process crate materials?

There's another issue with crate making that gets rarely talked about. In the image above we can see that a significant chunk of the crate profit comes from processing. But what if processing crate materials isn't even worth it in the first place?

Next to crate materials, cooking materials make up another huge market. Cooking materials are also lighter than timber/ores so you can stay afk longer. But are crate materials actually more profitable than those alternatives? You decide! 

The profit in this table auto-updates so I genuinely cannot tell you which side looks juicier when you read this  :)

| Crate Material                  | Cooking Material                |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| <!-- profit_processing-4661 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7105 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4664 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7103 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4667 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7101 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4667 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7106 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4652-->  | <!-- profit_processing-7205 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4654-->  | <!-- profit_processing-7203 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4658 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7201 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4066 --> | <!-- profit_processing-7206 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4067 --> | <!-- profit_processing-9062 --> |
| <!-- profit_processing-4077 --> | <!-- profit_processing-9063 --> |

Besides that, you may decide to spend your time on a different lifeskill entirely, like cooking, bartering or alchemy. I can personally make the most (semi-)afk money  from cooking, though it's slightly more effort than processing.


## Problem #2: Frozen Money

<img src="/files/tradingded/frozen_money.jpg">

When slowly building up a stack of crates over weeks or even months, all the money that goes into producing those crates gets frozen until you turn them in. If you're early in your gear progression, where upgrades are still fairly cheap, freezing billions worth of materials may significanly slow down your progress. For established players who are looking at tens of billions for an upgade, this is not so much of an issue. 

Incidentally, some people like trading for this exact same reason: it freezes their money so they can't gamble it away while going for an upgrade. Whenever they have saved enough money for their next upgrade, they do a trade-in and buy the item.

You could also bring up the argument that locking away silver for long periods of time is essentially an investment. While the risk of the 'crate investment' not paying off is fairly low (it can happen when your crates get destroyed during transport or you forget to connect nodes), there are far more profitable, yet sometimes riskier, investments. Investing money can be as simple as buying materials for your next cooking/alchemy/enchancing sessions while they're cheap, assuming that they will be more expensive once you need them. I hope you get the idea.

# So when should I consider trading?

To be fair, trading has seen a few QoL improvements which make it significantly easier to get into: getting to artisan 2 barely requires 1 stack of trash crates, you can insantly load a full stack of crates on a horse and an NPC crate transport system has been introduced to the game. Still, you should bring a good reason to get into trading.

Trading can look quite nice if you're looking to liquidate processing materials without interacting with the market. That can be either because you don't run a **Value Pack** or you simply dislike interacting with the market.  
If you regularly run a Value Pack, you should bring a fairly progressed account. This includes an established worker empire, say 350 CP and mostly prof+ workers, and a fair level of gear progression to not slow down your progress by freezing up money in crates. 

Besides that, you'll want to process a lot to keep your workshops from idling. For reference, a +3 crate worker can produce `4 crates x 5 crates per hour x 16 hours = 320 crates per day`. For a Calpheon Timber Crate, you're looking at `320 * 5 * 3 = 4800 plywood`, which requires ~50 minutes of processing at 1500 processing mastery. The more crates you produces a day, the more crates the cost for upkeeping the node connection will spread on, which means lower cost per crate.




Idling workshops means 

- enjoy running a crate empire and not too concerned about min-maxing profits
- seen some people use it to freeze money on purpose so they can't spend it




# Trading without processing? (Margin Trading)

You might say: I don't need to process my own crate materials, I can buy them straight off the market and make money completely passively. Well, yes, in theory. In practice, you better bring a damn high trading level, which in turn means spending billions of silver in trash crates to level up trading before you can think about margin trading.

# Summary

### Trading is for you if you...
- Process a lot and have developed a reasonably sized worker empire 
- OR:  Process a lot and can't rely on the marketplace to liquidate materials, for example because you **don't run a Value Pack**
- OR: simply enjoy running a crate empire and are not too concerned about profits :)

### Running a crate empire means...
- An initial investment of getting to artisan 2 and rolling for workers with the +3 packing skill
- Processing a lot to supply your workshops with materials (you will need to buy materials from the market)
- Locking up CP in workshops and a node connection
- Frequently feeding your crate workers
- As a reward, cashing in a fat stack of silver every few weeks/months

### Trading is not optimal if...
- You only process casually or not at all (see Problem #1)
- Locking up silver for weeks/months significantly slows down your progression (see Problem #2)
- You can spend the time and resources invested into trading on more profitable activities (this is the main argument people bring up against trading)


## Closing Thoughts

People have been mixing trading profits with other sources for as long as trading has been around. I highly recommend reading the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/8knbu6/current_state_of_crates/dz94nv5/?context=3) on this topic  by Goroshi, who is one of the top ranked trader's in the world (depending on when you read this probably **the** top ranked trader). 

Also don't forget that we're playing this game to have fun so you're free to do whatever you find enjoyable. The point of this post is to give you realistic expectations for what you're getting into with trading and not be fooled by those who claim to make spectacular profits.

I didn't know where else to put it,  but I have a hypthesis about trading. A few things that can go wrong with the trade-in: your horse dies when transporting crates or you forget to conect nodes. It doesn't happen often, but whenever it happens, you lose not only all the trading but also the processing and worker money, which creates a massive loss.

My (slightly cynical) hypothesis about trading:

`Across the whole playerbase, the total profit gained by crate trading is (close to) 0. All profit that is being created by successful crate turn-ins is evened out by botched turn-ins, failed transports, or people who buy horrendously overpriced materials.`
