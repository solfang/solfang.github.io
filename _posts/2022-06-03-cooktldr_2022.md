**All the cool kids are doing imperials. What's so special about it?**

One of the easiest ways to make money with cooking is imperial delivery.
It gives 45-120 mil profit for 5 minutes of work each day, depending on your mastery. [todo: make  blue text bold]
If you want to, you can make it even more profitable by gathering materials and cooking the dishes yourself.
The money comes straight from an NPC so there's no need for market PVP or a Value Pack to offload the meals.
Even at professional level, imperial boxes are good income. By leveling to guru and unlocking guru imperial boxes, the profit increases significantly.
Leveling cooking will increase your cooking mastery, which means higher imperial profit and higher cooking profit through additional procs and more crafts per hour.
The number of boxes you can hand in is limited and the limit depends on your CP (your CP divided by 2). Incidentally, the best way to gain CP is also by cooking.
All things considered, cooking is a great source of income and leveling your cooking to guru and beyond is a worthwhile endeavour.
